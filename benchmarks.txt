In order to evaluate whether a compilation strategy is good, we need
benchmarks to evaluate it on.

Features where performance is key:

1. Pattern Matching
2. Object Creation from scratch
3. Object Creation from other objects
4. Higher order function operations (map, fold, etc..)
5. Recursion/iteration


Some ideas for benchmarks:

1. max of a list
2. nat addition
3. word frequency
4. binary search tree insert
5. binary search tree delete
6. BST lookup
7. Red/black tree insert/delete/lookup
8. sorted list merge
9. string equality comparison
10. substring matching
